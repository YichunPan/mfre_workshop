    "# MFRE Coding Workshop 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the next week, we will be undergoing a crash course on the basics of computer science with a focus on applications in data manipulation and analysis. The course will be mostly taught in Python, a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Past the half way mark, we will be switching to R, another popular language for data analysis and visualization. While the syntax and structure of R is different from Python, the concepts and principles we have learned will still apply. And if I did my job right, you should be able to think about implementing code in R, even if it takes a bit of time to get used to the new language.\n",
    "\n",
    "You all should have recieved a recommndation early on to take CS50, a free online course offered by Harvard University. If you haven't already, I highly recommend you take the course as it will provide a solid foundation in computer science and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is meant to cover teh very basics of that course, enough for you to be able to understand and implement code in Python and R while also extending your knowledge to more advanced topics in data manipulation and analysis.\n",

The name of the variable can be anything you want, but it should be descriptive of the data it holds. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number.\n",

    "3. **PascalCase**: The first letter of each word is capitalized, e.g., `MyVariableName`.\n",

    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Each language has a set of data types that are used to represent different kinds of data. Python has several built-in data types that are commonly used in programming. Here are some of the most common data types in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **int**: Integer values, e.g., `42`.\n",
    "2. **float**: Floating-point values, e.g., `3.14`.\n",
    "3. **str**: String values, e.g., `'hello'`.\n",
    "4. **bool**: Boolean values, e.g., `True` or `False`.\n",
    "5. **list**: Ordered collection of values, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "6. **tuple**: Ordered, immutable collection of values, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`.\n",
    "7. **dict**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs, e.g., `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 42}`.\n",
    "8. **set**: Unordered collection of unique values, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data type has its own set of operations and methods that can be used to manipulate the data. For example, you can perform arithmetic operations on integers and floating-point values, but not on strings. Similarly, you can access elements in a list using an index, but not in a dictionary. Understanding the different data types and how to work with them is an important part of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data types can be converted to other data types using built-in functions. For example, you can convert an integer to a float using the `float()` function, or a float to an integer using the `int()` function. You can also convert a string to an integer or float if the string contains a valid representation of a number.\n",
    "\n",

    "When we try to add an integer to a float, Python will automatically convert the integer to a float and perform the addition. This is an example of type coercion, where Python automatically converts one data type to another to perform an operation. Type coercion can be useful in some cases, but it can also lead to unexpected results if you are not aware of how Python handles data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may get around this by converting the float to an integer before performing the addition. This is called type casting, where we explicitly convert a value from one data type to another. Type casting can be useful when you want to ensure that the data types are compatible before performing an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all data types can be converted to each other. For example, you cannot convert a string to a list or a dictionary directly. You will need to use other methods to convert the data to the desired format.\n",

    "If we try to convert a string that does not contain a valid representation of a number to an integer or float, Python will raise a `ValueError` indicating that the conversion is not possible.

Lists can contain values of different data types and can be modified after they are created. Lists are mutable, which means that you can change the values in a list after it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be created using square brackets `[]` and values separated by commas. You can access elements in a list using an index, which is the position of the element in the list. Indexing in Python starts at 0, so the first element in a list has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use negative indices to access elements from the end of the list. For example, `-1` refers to the last element in the list, `-2` refers to the second-to-last element, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be modified using methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, and `pop()`. These methods allow you to add, insert, remove, and retrieve elements from a list. You can also use slicing to access a subset of elements from a list. Slicing is done using the colon `:` operator and allows you to specify a start index, end index, and step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a versatile data type that can be used to store collections of values of any data type. They are commonly used in Python for tasks like storing data, iterating over elements, and manipulating sequences of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are another common data type in Python that are used to store key-value pairs. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. Dictionaries can contain values of different data types and can be modified after they are created. Dictionaries are mutable, which means that you can change the values associated with a key after the dictionary is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries can be created using curly braces `{}` and key-value pairs separated by colons `:`. You can access values in a dictionary using the key, which is a unique identifier for the value. If you try to access a key that does not exist in the dictionary, Python will raise a `KeyError` indicating that the key is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify a dictionary by adding, updating, or removing key-value pairs. You can also use methods like `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` to access the keys, values, and key-value pairs in a dictionary. Dictionaries are a powerful data type that can be used to store and manipulate structured data in Python."

Operators are an important part of programming and are used in many different contexts to manipulate data and control the flow of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of operators in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arithmetic operators**: Used to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "2. **Comparison operators**: Used to compare values and return a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false.\n",
    "3. **Logical operators**: Used to combine multiple conditions and return a boolean value indicating whether the conditions are true or false.\n",
    "4. **Assignment operators**: Used to assign values to variables.\n",
    "5. **Identity operators**: Used to compare the memory location of two objects.\n",
    "6. **Membership operators**: Used to check if a value is present in a sequence like a list or a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operators work on numbers and return a numerical value as the result. You can use arithmetic operators to perform calculations in a program and manipulate numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false. These operators work on numbers, strings, and other data types and allow you to compare values in a program. You can use comparison operators to make decisions based on conditions and control the flow of a program.\n",

These operators work on boolean values and allow you to create more complex conditions in a program. You can use logical operators to combine conditions and control the flow of a program.\n",

    "Identity operators are used to compare the memory location of two objects. These operators allow you to check if two objects are the same object in memory. You can use identity operators to compare objects and check if they are the same instance in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Membership operators are used to check if a value is present in a sequence like a list or a dictionary. These operators allow you to check if a value is in a collection of values and return a boolean value indicating whether the value is present. You can use membership operators to search for values in a sequence and perform different actions based on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are an important part of programming and are used in many different contexts to manipulate data and control the flow of a program. By understanding how operators work and how to use them in your code, you can create more complex programs that can perform a wide range of tasks.\n",

    "In programming, abstraction is used to create classes, functions, and modules that encapsulate the details of a system and provide a simplified interface for working with the system. Abstraction allows you to focus on the high-level concepts of a system without getting bogged down in the details of how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is an important concept in programming and is used in many different contexts to manage complexity and create more maintainable and scalable code. By using abstraction, you can create programs that are easier to understand, modify, and extend, and that can be reused in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you should have seen in the `r_intro.Rmd` file, using pseudocode is a good way to plan out your code before you start writing it. Pseudocode is an informal way of describing how a program will work using plain language and simple notation. It allows you to focus on the high-level concepts of a program without getting bogged down in the details of the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining pseudo code with abstraction, you can create a plan for your code that breaks down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts and provides a roadmap for how the code will work. This can help you organize your thoughts, identify potential issues, and create a clear plan for how to implement the code."
