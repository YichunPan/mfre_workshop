    "\n",
    "Throughout the next week, we will be undergoing a crash course on the basics of computer science with a focus on applications in data manipulation and analysis. The course will be mostly taught in Python, a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Past the half way mark, we will be switching to R, another popular language for data analysis and visualization. While the syntax and structure of R is different from Python, the concepts and principles we have learned will still apply. And if I did my job right, you should be able to think about implementing code in R, even if it takes a bit of time to get used to the new language.\n",
    "\n",
    "You all should have recieved a recommndation early on to take CS50, a free online course offered by Harvard University. If you haven't already, I highly recommend you take the course as it will provide a solid foundation in computer science and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is meant to cover the very basics of that course, enough for you to be able to understand and implement code in Python and R while also extending your knowledge to more advanced topics in data manipulation and analysis.\n",

The name of the variable can be anything you want, but it should be descriptive of the data it holds. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **CamelCase**: The first letter of each word is capitalized except for the first word, e.g., `myVariableName`.\n",

    "3. **PascalCase**: The first letter of each word is capitalized, e.g., `MyVariableName`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive variable names become espeecially important when you are working on large projects with many variables. It is a good idea to use names that are meaningful and indicate what the variable is used for.\n",

A local variable is one that is defined inside a function and is only accessible from within that function.\n",

    "1. **int**: Integer values (Whole numbers), e.g., `42`.\n",
    "2. **float**: Floating-point values (Numbers with decimals), e.g., `3.14`.\n",
    "3. **str**: String values, e.g., `'hello'`.\n",
    "4. **bool**: Boolean values, e.g., `True` or `False`.\n",
    "5. **list**: Ordered collection of values, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "6. **tuple**: Ordered, immutable collection of values, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`.\n",
    "7. **dict**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs, e.g., `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 42}`.\n",
    "8. **set**: Unordered collection of unique values, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data type has its own set of operations and methods that can be used to manipulate the data. For example, you can perform arithmetic operations on integers and floating-point values, but not on strings. Similarly, you can access elements in a list using an index, but not in a dictionary. Understanding the different data types and how to work with them is an important part of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data types can be converted to other data types using built-in functions. For example, you can convert an integer to a float using the `float()` function, or a float to an integer using the `int()` function. You can also convert a string to an integer or float if the string contains a valid representation of a number.\n",

    "When we try to add an integer to a float, Python will automatically convert the integer to a float and perform the addition. This is an example of type coercion, where Python automatically converts one data type to another to perform an operation. Type coercion can be useful in some cases, but it can also lead to unexpected results if you are not aware of how Python handles data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may get around this by converting the float to an integer before performing the addition. This is called type casting, where we explicitly convert a value from one data type to another. Type casting can be useful when you want to ensure that the data types are compatible before performing an operation.\n",

Dictionaries can contain values of different data types and can be modified after they are created. Dictionaries are mutable, which means that you can change the values associated with a key after the dictionary is created.\n",

    "Dictionaries can be created using curly braces `{}` and key-value pairs separated by colons `:`. You can access values in a dictionary using the key, which is a unique identifier for the value. If you try to access a key that does not exist in the dictionary, Python will raise a `KeyError` indicating that the key is not found.\n",

    "You can modify a dictionary by adding, updating, or removing key-value pairs. You can also use methods like `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` to access the keys, values, and key-value pairs in a dictionary.

    "\n",
    "When you create a variable in a program, it is stored in memory in one of two places: the stack or the heap. The stack is used for static memory allocation, while the heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. Understanding the difference between the stack and the heap is important for writing efficient and bug-free code.\n",

    "The stack is a region of memory that is used for static memory allocation. When a function is called, a block of memory is allocated on the stack to store the function's arguments, return address, and local variables. The stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure, which means that the last item added to the stack is the first item removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack is fast and efficient because memory is allocated and deallocated in a strict order. When a function returns, the memory allocated for the function is automatically deallocated, which prevents memory leaks and makes the stack a reliable way to manage memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heap is a region of memory that is used for dynamic memory allocation. When you create a variable on the heap, memory is allocated from a pool of memory that is managed by the operating system. The heap is a more flexible way to manage memory because you can allocate and deallocate memory at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heap is slower than the stack because memory allocation and deallocation are not as efficient. When you allocate memory on the heap, the operating system has to search for a block of memory that is large enough to hold the data. When you deallocate memory on the heap, the memory is not automatically freed, which can lead to memory leaks if you forget to free the memory."

    "## Operators and Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are used to perform operations on values in a program. They allow you to perform arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations on numbers, strings, and other data types. Operators are an important part of programming and are used in many different contexts to manipulate data and control the flow of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of operators in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arithmetic operators**: Used to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
    "2. **Comparison operators**: Used to compare values and return a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false.\n",
    "3. **Logical operators**: Used to combine multiple conditions and return a boolean value indicating whether the conditions are true or false.\n",
    "4. **Assignment operators**: Used to assign values to variables.\n",
    "5. **Identity operators**: Used to compare the memory location of two objects.\n",
    "6. **Membership operators**: Used to check if a value is present in a sequence like a list or a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operators work on numbers and return a numerical value as the result. You can use arithmetic operators to perform calculations in a program and manipulate numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false. These operators work on numbers, strings, and other data types and allow you to compare values in a program. You can use comparison operators to make decisions based on conditions and control the flow of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a boolean value indicating whether the conditions are true or false. These operators work on boolean values and allow you to create more complex conditions in a program. You can use logical operators to combine conditions and control the flow of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. These operators allow you to store data in a variable and manipulate it in a program. You can use assignment operators to create variables, update their values, and perform calculations with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity operators are used to compare the memory location of two objects. These operators allow you to check if two objects are the same object in memory. You can use identity operators to compare objects and check if they are the same instance in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Membership operators are used to check if a value is present in a sequence like a list or a dictionary. These operators allow you to check if a value is in a collection of values and return a boolean value indicating whether the value is present. You can use membership operators to search for values in a sequence and perform different actions based on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are an important part of programming and are used in many different contexts to manipulate data and control the flow of a program. By understanding how operators work and how to use them in your code, you can create more complex programs that can perform a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen a few of these operators in action in the examples above. We used arithmetic operators to perform calculations, comparison operators to make decisions, and logical operators to combine conditions. These operators are essential tools in programming and are used in many different contexts to manipulate data and control the flow of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a programming concept that allows you to hide the details of a complex system and work with a simplified view of the system. Abstraction is used to manage complexity and make it easier to work with large, complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, abstraction is used to create classes, functions, and modules that encapsulate the details of a system and provide a simplified interface for working with the system. Abstraction allows you to focus on the high-level concepts of a system without getting bogged down in the details of how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is an important concept in programming and is used in many different contexts to manage complexity and create more maintainable and scalable code. By using abstraction, you can create programs that are easier to understand, modify, and extend, and that can be reused in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you should have seen in the `r_intro.Rmd` file, using pseudocode is a good way to plan out your code before you start writing it. Pseudocode is an informal way of describing how a program will work using plain language and simple notation. It allows you to focus on the high-level concepts of a program without getting bogged down in the details of the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining pseudo code with abstraction, you can create a plan for your code that breaks down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts and provides a roadmap for how the code will work. This can help you organize your thoughts, identify potential issues, and create a clear plan for how to implement the code."

    "\n",
    "Syntactic sugar is a programming concept that refers to syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or express. Syntactic sugar is used to simplify the syntax of a language and make it more user-friendly by providing shortcuts or alternative ways of writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several examples of syntactic sugar that make the language easier to read and write. For example, list comprehensions are a concise way of creating lists from other lists or iterables. List comprehensions allow you to create a new list by applying an expression to each element in an existing list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of syntactic sugar in Python is the `with` statement, which is used to manage resources like files, sockets, and database connections. The `with` statement provides a way to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up after they are used by automatically closing the resource when the block of code is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactic sugar is an important concept in programming and is used in many different languages to simplify the syntax and make it easier to read and write code. By using syntactic sugar, you can create code that is more concise, expressive, and maintainable, and that is easier to understand for other developers."

    "## Debugging and Error Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a program. Errors can occur for many reasons, including typos, syntax errors, logic errors, and runtime errors. Debugging is an important skill for programmers and is used to ensure that a program works as intended and produces the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several tools and techniques that can be used to debug a program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Print statements**: Print statements are a simple and effective way to debug a program. By adding print statements to your code, you can check the values of variables and the flow of the program to identify errors and track down bugs.\n",
    "2. **Debugger**: A debugger is a tool that allows you to step through a program line by line and inspect the values of variables. Debuggers provide a visual interface for debugging and can help you identify errors and fix bugs more efficiently.\n",
    "3. **Logging**: Logging is a technique that allows you to record information about the execution of a program. By adding log messages to your code, you can track the flow of the program and identify errors and issues.\n",
    "4. **Unit tests**: Unit tests are small, self-contained tests that verify the correctness of a specific piece of code. By writing unit tests for your code, you can ensure that it works as intended and catch errors before they become a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error codes are used to indicate that an error has occurred in a program. Error codes are typically numeric values that are returned by functions and methods to indicate the type of error that occurred. By checking the error code, you can determine the cause of the error and take appropriate action to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several common error codes that are used in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SyntaxError**: Indicates that there is a syntax error in the code.\n",
    "2. **NameError**: Indicates that a variable or function is not defined.\n",
    "3. **TypeError**: Indicates that an operation is performed on an object of the wrong type.\n",
    "4. **ValueError**: Indicates that a function is called with an invalid argument.\n",
    "5. **KeyError**: Indicates that a key is not found in a dictionary.\n",
    "6. **IndexError**: Indicates that an index is out of range.\n",
    "7. **FileNotFoundError**: Indicates that a file is not found.\n",
    "8. **ZeroDivisionError**: Indicates that division by zero is attempted.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding error codes and how to handle them, you can write more robust and reliable code that is less likely to crash or produce unexpected results. Error handling is an important part of programming and is used to ensure that a program runs smoothly and produces the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get an error, read it carefully to understand what went wrong and where the error occurred. Look for the error message, which will provide information about the type of error and the line of code where it occurred. By reading the error message and understanding the error code, you can identify the cause of the error and take appropriate action to fix it. Getting errors can be frustrating, but it can be a good thing. This makes your bug more visible and easier to fix."

    "## Git and Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a distributed version control system that is used to track changes in a project and collaborate with other developers. Git allows you to create a repository to store your code, track changes to the code, and work with other developers to make changes to the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several key concepts in Git that are important to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Repository**: A repository is a collection of files and directories that make up a project. A repository is stored on a server and can be accessed by multiple developers.\n",
    "2. **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of the code at a specific point in time. Commits are used to track changes to the code and provide a history of the project.\n",
    "3. **Branch**: A branch is a separate line of development in a repository. Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes in isolation and merge them back into the main codebase when they are ready.\n",
    "4. **Merge**: A merge is the process of combining the changes from one branch into another. Merges are used to integrate changes from different branches and keep the codebase up to date.\n",
    "5. **Pull request**: A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another. Pull requests are used to review and discuss changes before they are merged into the main codebase.\n",
    "6. **Conflict**: A conflict occurs when two branches have made changes to the same part of a file. Conflicts must be resolved before the changes can be merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Git and version control, you can track changes to your code, collaborate with other developers, and manage the development of a project more effectively. Git is an essential tool for programmers and is used in many different contexts to manage code and work with other developers. You can find installation instructions and the full documentation for Git on the [official website](https://git-scm.com/). Here are some common Git commands that you will use when working with Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **git init**: Initialize a new Git repository.\n",
    "2. **git clone**: Clone a repository from a remote server.\n",
    "3. **git add**: Add changes to the staging area.\n",
    "4. **git commit**: Commit changes to the repository.\n",
    "5. **git push**: Push changes to a remote repository.\n",
    "6. **git pull**: Pull changes from a remote repository.\n",
    "7. **git branch**: Create, list, or delete branches.\n",
    "8. **git checkout**: Switch branches or restore files.\n",
    "9. **git merge**: Merge changes from one branch into another.\n",
    "10. **git status**: Show the status of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a git commit: `git commit -m \"message\"`. Most developers recommend doing frequent and atomic commits. This means that you should commit your changes often and in small, self-contained units. This makes it easier to track changes, review code, and collaborate with other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extension of Git is GitHub, which is a web-based platform that allows you to host and collaborate on Git repositories. GitHub provides a range of features for managing code, tracking issues, and collaborating with other developers. GitHub is widely used in the programming community and is a valuable tool for managing code and working with other developers. Git hub is where all the materials for this workshop is being hosted and where you can find the latest updates and resources. When playing around with repositories on GitHub, you can fork a repository to create a copy of it in your own account, make changes to the code, and submit a pull request to merge your changes back into the original repository."

    "Given the variance in the operating systems everyone is using, we will not be covering this in detail. However, here are some recommended procedures to set up your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Linux or MacOS**: These operating systems are more developer-friendly and have better support for programming tools and libraries.\n",
    "2. **Install a package manager**: Package managers like Homebrew for MacOS and APT for Linux make it easy to install and manage software packages.\n",
    "3. **Use a text editor or IDE**: Text editors like Visual Studio Code and IDEs like PyCharm are popular choices for programming in Python.\n",
    "4. **Set up a virtual environment**: Virtual environments allow you to create isolated environments for your projects and manage dependencies more effectively.\n",
    "5. **Install Python**: Python is the programming language we will be using for this workshop. You can download and install Python from the official website.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using windows, forunately you can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run a Linux distribution alongside your Windows installation. This will give you access to a Linux terminal and allow you to use Linux tools and utilities on your Windows machine. You can also use a virtual machine or a cloud-based development environment to run a Linux distribution on your Windows machine. This will give you access to a Linux environment and allow you to use Linux tools and utilities on your Windows machine. You can also use a cloud-based development environment like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to run Python code in a browser-based environment, these environments are usually run Debain. This will give you access to a Python interpreter and allow you to run Python code without installing anything on your local machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you want to start a new project, I recommend you to create a new directory for the project and set up a virtual environment for the project. This will keep your project files organized and prevent conflicts between different projects. You can create a new directory using the `mkdir` command and set up a virtual environment using the `python -m venv` command. This will create a new directory for the project and set up a virtual environment in the directory. You can then activate the virtual environment using the `source` command and install the dependencies for the project using the `pip install` command. This will create a new virtual environment for the project and install the dependencies in the virtual environment. You can then run the project using the `python` command and deactivate the virtual environment using the `deactivate` command. I also recommend that you restart your code editor in the current directory of your project to ensure that the virtual environment is activated and the dependencies are installed correctly. Whenever possible, you should also use a version control system like Git to track changes to your code and collaborate with other developers. This will allow you to manage your code more effectively and work with other developers to make changes to the codebase."
