    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). For example, a car is an object which has certain properties such as color, model, and certain methods such as drive, stop, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for the object. We can think of class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object. When we create an object of a class, we are creating an instance of the class. This process is known as instantiation."

    "### Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance\n",
    "    - Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class). \n",
    "2. Encapsulation\n",
    "    - Encapsulation is an another mechanism to restrict direct access to some of the object's components. Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member.\n",
    "3. Polymorphism\n",
    "    - Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "4. Abstraction\n",
    "    - Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that \"shows\" only essential attributes and \"hides\" unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users."

    "### Benefits of Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity for easier troubleshooting**\n",
    "    - Something has gone wrong, and you have no idea where to look. Is the problem in the Widget, or is it the Wodget? If objects are well defined, you can more easily narrow down the problem to a particular object.\n",
    "2. **Reuse of code through inheritance**\n",
    "    - If an object already exists (perhaps written by someone else in your company), you can use that object in your program. And, if you have an object that almost does what you want but just needs a little extra functionality, you can create a new object based on the existing object.\n",
    "3. **Flexibility through polymorphism**\n",
    "    - If you have a bunch of objects that are all of the same class, but you want to iterate over them and call a particular method for each, polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes the same way if they contain a particular method.\n",
    "4. **Interface Descriptions**\n",
    "    - Objects can be described by the interfaces they support. If an object says it supports a particular interface, it means that the object has certain methods and properties. If an object says it supports a particular interface, it means that the object has certain methods and properties.\n",

We can use lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and many other data structures to store and manipulate data. We can also use libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to handle data more efficiently.\n",

    "3. Sets\n",
    "    - A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.\n",
    "4. Dictionaries\n",
    "    - A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my personal experience, you're going to be using lists and dictionaries the most. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would use a list when you have a collection of items that you want to keep in order. For example, you might use a list to store the names of all the students in a class. You would use a dictionary when you have a collection of items that you want to access by a unique key. For example, you might use a dictionary to store the email addresses of all the students in a class, with the student names as the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can nest lists and dictionaries inside each other to create more complex data structures. For example, you might use a list of dictionaries to store information about a collection of students, with each dictionary representing a student. You can similarly nest lists within dictionaries and lists within lists and dictionaries within dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be tempted to always use dictionaries as they are more flexible than lists, but remember that lists are more efficient for storing ordered collections of items. As a rule of thumb, use lists when you need to keep items in order, and use dictionaries when you need to access items by a unique key.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason you may want to use a list over a dictionary is if you need to access items by their index. Lists are ordered collections, so you can access items by their index. Dictionaries are unordered collections, so you can't access items by their index.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way you can use a dictionary to store items in order is to use a dictionary with integer keys. For example, you could use a dictionary with integer keys to store the names of all the students in a class, with the student names as the values and the student IDs as the keys. This way, you can access the student names by their student IDs. This way you can take advantage of the flexibility of dictionaries while still keeping items in order to enable indexing.

When you multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix. The elements of the resulting matrix are calculated by taking the dot product of the corresponding rows and columns of the two matrices. This is reffered to as the dot product.\n",

This will return a new array with the same shape as the original array, where each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element of the original array.

A DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure that can hold multiple Series objects. You can think of a DataFrame as a table, where each row is a Series and each column is a column in the table.\n",

You can use the `head()` method to view the first few rows of a DataFrame. You can use the `tail()` method to view the last few rows of a DataFrame. You can use the `info()` method to view information about a DataFrame, including the data types of each column and the number of non-null values in each column. You can use the `describe()` method to view summary statistics about a DataFrame, including the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles of each column.\n",

    "## Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to \"learn\" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) from data, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It is based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Overview of Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear Regression\n",
    "    - Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In linear regression, the dependent variable is a continuous variable, while the independent variables can be continuous or categorical variables. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line through the data, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression\n",
    "    - Logistic regression is a statistical model that is used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable, while the independent variables can be continuous or categorical variables. The goal of logistic regression is to find the best-fitting line through the data, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.\n",
    "3. Decision Trees\n",
    "    - Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. A decision tree is a tree-like structure that is made up of nodes and branches. Each node represents a decision point, and each branch represents a possible outcome of that decision. The goal of a decision tree is to split the data into subsets that are as homogeneous as possible with respect to the target variable.\n",
    "4. Random Forest\n",
    "    - Random forests are an ensemble learning method that is used for classification and regression tasks. An ensemble learning method is a method that combines the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance of the model. Random forests are made up of multiple decision trees, each of which is trained on a random subset of the data. The predictions of the individual decision trees are then combined to make the final prediction.\n",
    "5. Support Vector Machines\n",
    "    - Support vector machines are a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. Support vector machines work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into two classes. The hyperplane is the line that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The goal of support vector machines is to find the hyperplane that best separates the data into two classes, while minimizing the classification error.\n",
    "6. K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "    - K-nearest neighbors is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. K-nearest neighbors works by finding the k-nearest neighbors of a data point, and then using the majority class of the k-nearest neighbors to make a prediction. The value of k is a hyperparameter that can be tuned to improve the performance of the model.\n",
    "7. K-Means Clustering\n",
    "    - K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for clustering tasks. K-means clustering works by finding the k clusters that best separate the data into groups. The value of k is a hyperparameter that can be tuned to improve the performance of the model. The goal of k-means clustering is to find the k clusters that best separate the data into groups, while minimizing the within-cluster variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides classes and functions for estimating many different machine learning models, including classification models, regression models, and clustering models. Scikit-learn also provides classes and functions for evaluating the performance of machine learning models, including cross-validation, grid search, and model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `fit()` method to fit a machine learning model to the data. You can use the `predict()` method to make predictions with the model. You can use the `score()` method to evaluate the performance of the model. You can use the `cross_val_score()` function to evaluate the performance of the model using cross-validation. You can use the `GridSearchCV()` class to perform grid search on the hyperparameters of the model.\n",
