    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). For example, a car is an object which has certain properties such as color, model, and certain methods such as drive, stop, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a blueprint for the object. We can think of class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object. When we create an object of a class, we are creating an instance of the class. This process is known as instantiation."

    "### Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inheritance\n",
    "    - Inheritance is a way of creating a new class for using details of an existing class without modifying it. The newly formed class is a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class). \n",
    "2. Encapsulation\n",
    "    - Encapsulation is an another mechanism to restrict direct access to some of the object's components. Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member.\n",
    "3. Polymorphism\n",
    "    - Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "4. Abstraction\n",
    "    - Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that \"shows\" only essential attributes and \"hides\" unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users."

    "### Benefits of Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity for easier troubleshooting**\n",
    "    - Something has gone wrong, and you have no idea where to look. Is the problem in the Widget, or is it the Wodget? If objects are well defined, you can more easily narrow down the problem to a particular object.\n",
    "2. **Reuse of code through inheritance**\n",
    "    - If an object already exists (perhaps written by someone else in your company), you can use that object in your program. And, if you have an object that almost does what you want but just needs a little extra functionality, you can create a new object based on the existing object.\n",
    "3. **Flexibility through polymorphism**\n",
    "    - If you have a bunch of objects that are all of the same class, but you want to iterate over them and call a particular method for each, polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes the same way if they contain a particular method.\n",
    "4. **Interface Descriptions**\n",
    "    - Objects can be described by the interfaces they support. If an object says it supports a particular interface, it means that the object has certain methods and properties. If an object says it supports a particular interface, it means that the object has certain methods and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming is a very important concept in Python. It is the foundation of many libraries and frameworks in Python. In order to better understand the concept of Object Oriented Programming, you can refer to the following resources:\n",
