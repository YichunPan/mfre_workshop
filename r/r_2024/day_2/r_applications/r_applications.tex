\begin{frame}{Hypothesis Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data.
        \item A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data.
        \item These two statements are called the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hypothesis Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{2em}
        \item The null hypothesis is the statement being tested. Usually, the null hypothesis states that there is no effect or no difference.
        \item The alternative hypothesis is the statement that is accepted if the sample data provide enough evidence that the null hypothesis is false.
        \item The alternative hypothesis states that there is an effect or a difference.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hypothesis Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{2em}
        \item The hypothesis test is conducted by comparing the value of the test statistic to a critical value.
        \item The critical value is a value that determines whether the null hypothesis can be rejected.
        \item If the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, then the null hypothesis is rejected.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hypothesis Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{2em}
        \item The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one computed from the sample data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
        \item If the p-value is less than the significance level, then the null hypothesis is rejected.
        \item The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.

\begin{frame}{Hypothesis Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{2em}

        \item The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.
        \item The p-value is compared to the significance level to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected.
